===============

To get started using ``django-lbtagging`` simply install it with

    $ pip install django-lbtagging


Add ``"lbtagging"`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

And then to any model you want tagging on do the following::

    from django.db import models

    from lbtagging.managers import TaggableManager

    class Food(models.Model):
        # ... fields here

        tags = TaggableManager()
